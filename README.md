This is a personal project for a WordPress headless theme built with ReactJS, Typescript, GraphQL and Bootstrap 4.

The theme started by implementing the main components of a basic blog, then to make it more interesting I added components from a famous plugin (WP-Travel) and transformed the blog into an OTA website.

**This project is currently under development and may present some bugs.**
